Uniform Cost Search
A* Search
The program uses these search algorithms to return the best route to take in the London Underground. Uniform Cost search modified to also take into consideration train transfers and average time between stations.
The heuristic used for A* is subtracting the goal train zone from the starting train zone to make the search stay within the boundaries and not search Stations that are too far away from the destination train zone
